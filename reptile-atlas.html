											<h3>Reporting a Reptile</h3>
											<p>The intent is to make it easier for the atlases to be updated as well as increase usability. One of the ways we can do this is by increasing the ease of specimen submission. If we see interest in continued support for the collections and atlas, this button will link to a report form where users can easily officially report sightings to the collections. These sightings can then be vetted by the collections manager and then pushed to the collections and to these pages.</p>

											<p>The intent of this atlas is to remain true to Dr. Floyd Scott's original vision with the amphibian and reptile atlases while modernizing them in a way that allows for more frequent updates and makes them more functional for contemporary users.</p>

											<h3>How this works</h3>
											<p>Links to species accounts on this atlas start on the left hand side of this page (or bottom of this page if you are                           on mobile) after the "report a reptile" link. Currently we have pages developed for four species, Copperheads,                               Timber Rattlesnakes, Rough Green Snakes, and Alligator Snapping Turtles. In addition to maintaining the integrity                            and functionality of the previous atlas, a dynamic map on the bottom of the screen allows you to further explore                             specimen records for that species. This pulls specimen records from within our collections as well as any museum                             specimen records that have been pushed to Vertnet or GBif. Counties where museum records exist are bordered in                              black and filled in a transparent gray. It also allows you to view any Inaturalist submissions for that species                              within the state alongside museum records. Inaturalist records are citizen science and are considered unofficial in                          regards to the atlas, but being able to view them gives an idea of where else this species may occur in the state.                           Clicking a museum record or inaturalist record links you to that specific records webpage where available</p>

											<p>Within the new atlas, species of concern within the state and common species are treated differently. These statuses                          are determined by the Tennessee Wildlife Action Plan, in our examples Rough Green Snake and Copperhead are                                   considered "Common" and Timber Rattlesnakes and Alligator Snapping Turtles are considered species of greatest conservation concern. GCN                                species are mapped as described above, with verbatim localities reported on both the static and dynamic maps. For                            protected species, only official specimen records are reported and localities are obscured. Instead of reporting                              actual locations for the specimen records, a number of random points equal to the number of reports of that species                          are generated within each county. This still allows a sense of the species occurrence and density within each county                          but protects the exact localities.</p>
